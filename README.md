# Tabular Data Classification 

This project demonstrates how to build and train machine learning models for **tabular data classification**.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.


## ‚ö° Features
- Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Model training using **Scikit-learn** and/or **PyTorch**.
- Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Easily extendable to new tabular datasets.
