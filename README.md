Tabular Data Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a tabular data classification project. The notebook demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to classify different types of rice based on their features.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build a robust classification model. The dataset used for this project is hosted on Kaggle and includes various features of different rice grains.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Rice Type Classification" from Kaggle. It can be accessed and downloaded directly within the notebook using the Kaggle API.

Features:

Area: The area of the rice grain.

MajorAxisLength: The longest dimension of the rice grain.

MinorAxisLength: The shortest dimension of the rice grain.

Eccentricity: A measure of how an elliptical object deviates from being circular.

ConvexArea: The smallest convex polygon that contains the rice grain.

EquivDiameter: The diameter of a circle with the same area as the rice grain.

Extent: The ratio of the area of the grain to the area of its bounding box.

Perimeter: The perimeter of the rice grain.

Roundness: A measure of how round the rice grain is.

AspectRation: The ratio of the major axis to the minor axis.

Class: The type of rice (e.g., Basmati, Arborio).

Dependencies
The project is built using Python and requires several libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. Please refer to the requirements.txt file for a full list of dependencies.

Usage
Clone this repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Tabular_Data_Classification.ipynb notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code, Google Colab).

Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
